# angle-ti84
a TI-84+ programm to calculate angles by giving pointsor vectors as input
you can run it by transfering the file to the calculator, and then execute it by pressing the "prgm" button, and selecting "TI-Basic" and then "VAR".
when Executed you can choose between two modes: Point and Vector.
## Point
when selecting point it asks you for different inputs here you type in the coordinates from the points in the following order 
X
Y
Z
for Point A,B, and C.
when done it asks you to select the Point at which the angle shall be calculated.
It then outputs the angle in Degrees
## Vector 
when selecting Vector the programm asks you to put in the two vectors, which angle you want to calculate.
here you need to type the vectors in the followinfg format in
a1
a2
a3
b1
b2
b3
when done it outputs the angle
##
## IMPORTANT!
when trying to calculate it is important to select "DEGREE" in the "mode" menu
